## ⚡ **From Big Consulting to Fast-Paced Startups—My Data Science Adventure**  

I started out dreaming of designing **wind turbines**, but somehow ended up **optimizing algorithms instead of circuits**.  
And honestly? **Best accidental pivot ever.** 🎯  

From **top professional services firms like Deloitte** to **fast-paced startups like KOBEYO**, my journey has been a wild ride.  
🚀 **Big data, even bigger ambitions, and an endless thirst for solving complex problems with AI.**  

🌱 **Where It All Started**  
🔹 **Hexaware Technologies** → Built a **custom NER model** for a retail client & developed a **loan default prediction** model.  
🔹 **Deloitte Consulting USI** → Designed **NLP models** to process news alerts, automated **risk event tracking**, and built **proof-of-concept AI solutions**.  

🔥 **Jumping into the Startup World**  
🔹 **CodeModulo Technologies** → Enhanced **BI solutions** using **LLMs (LLaMA, Claude)** & optimized **chatbot interactions**.  
🔹 **Leeds School of Business** → Developed **LLM-powered models** to analyze **human behavior patterns**.  
🔹 **KOBEYO (Current Role)** → **The startup grind!** Designing **Tableau dashboards**, leading **geospatial job market analysis**, and **automating data pipelines** at **startup speed.**  

📚 **Master’s in Data Science at CU Boulder** → **Graduating May 2025** 🎓  

Each twist and turn in my journey has reinforced my **obsession with AI**, and I’m all about pushing the boundaries of **data-driven problem-solving**.
